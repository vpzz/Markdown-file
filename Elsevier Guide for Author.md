***Use of word processing software\***
It is important that the file be saved in the native format of the word processor used. The text should be in single-column format 单栏格式. Keep the layout of the text as simple as possible 布局尽可能简单. Most formatting codes will be removed and replaced on processing the article. In particular, do not use the word processor's options to justify text or to hyphenate words 不要用软件的选项来对正文字和断字. However, do use bold face, italics, subscripts, superscripts etc 但是可以使用粗体，斜体，上下标 . When preparing tables, if you are using a table grid, use only one grid for each individual table and not a grid for each row 三线表，不要每行都用一个网格. If no grid is used, use tabs, not spaces, to align columns. The electronic text should be prepared in a way very similar to that of conventional manuscripts (see also the [Guide to Publishing with Elsevier](https://www.elsevier.com/authors/journal-authors/submit-your-paper)). Note that source files of figures, tables and text graphics will be required whether or not you embed your figures in the text. See also the section on Electronic artwork.无论是否在文中嵌入了图表，都需要提供图表的源文件。
To avoid unnecessary errors you are strongly advised to use the 'spell-check' and 'grammar-check' functions of your word processor. 强烈建议使用软件自带的拼写和语法检查功能。

You are recommended to use the Elsevier article class [elsarticle.cls](http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/elsarticle) to prepare your manuscript and [BibTeX](http://www.bibtex.org/) to generate your bibliography.
Our [LaTeX site](https://www.elsevier.com/latex) has detailed submission instructions, templates and other information.

**Article structure**

***Subdivision - numbered sections\***
Divide your article into clearly defined and numbered sections. Subsections should be numbered 1.1 (then 1.1.1, 1.1.2, ...), 1.2, etc. (the abstract is not included in section numbering) ==给文章分章节，摘要不用== . Use this numbering also for internal cross-referencing: do not just refer to 'the text' ==文中交叉引用也应使用章节编号== . Any subsection may be given a brief heading. Each heading should appear on its own separate line. ==每章节都应有个小标题，单独占一行。==

***Introduction\***
State the objectives of the work and provide an adequate background, avoiding a detailed literature survey or a summary of the results. ==不要写太详细的文献综述和罗列结果==。

***Theory/calculation\***
A Theory section should extend, not repeat, the background to the article already dealt with in the Introduction and lay the foundation for further work. In contrast, a Calculation section represents a practical development from a theoretical basis.

***Results\***
Results should be clear and concise.

***Discussion\***
This should explore the significance of the results of the work, not repeat them ==突出结果的重要性，不是重复叙述== . A combined Results and Discussion section is often appropriate ==结果和讨论经常可以合并写== . Avoid extensive citations and discussion of published literature. ==尽量避免太多的对已有文献的引用和评述==。

***Conclusions\***
The main conclusions of the study may be presented in a short Conclusions section, which may stand alone or form a subsection of a Discussion or Results and Discussion section. 结论可以单独成章，也可以作为结果与讨论的子章，不要太长。

***Appendices\***
If there is more than one appendix, they should be identified as A, B, etc 附录使用A,B,C编号. Formulae and equations in appendices should be given separate numbering: Eq. (A.1), Eq. (A.2), etc.附录中的公式应单独编号; in a subsequent appendix, Eq. (B.1) and so on. Similarly for tables and figures: Table A.1; Fig. A.1, etc.附录中的图表也应单独编号。

**Essential title page information**

**==标题页的主要信息==**

• ***Title.*** Concise and informative. Titles are often used in information-retrieval 信息检索 systems. Avoid abbreviations and formulae where possible. ==尽可能避免缩写==
• ***Author names and affiliations.*** Please clearly indicate the given name(s) and family name(s) of each author and check that all names are accurately spelled 清晰地指出每个作者的名和姓 . You can add your name between parentheses in your own script behind the English transliteration. Present the authors' affiliation addresses (where the actual work was done) below the names. Indicate all affiliations with a lower-case superscript letter immediately after the author's name and in front of the appropriate address. Provide the full postal address of each affiliation 提供每个机构的邮政地址, including the country name and, if available, the e-mail address of each author.
• ***Corresponding author.*** Clearly indicate who will handle correspondence at all stages of refereeing and publication, also post-publication. 通讯作者负责在审稿，出版前后的沟通工作 This responsibility includes answering any future queries about Methodology and Materials. **Ensure that the e-mail address is given and that contact details are kept up to date by the corresponding author.**
• ***Present/permanent address.*** If an author has moved since the work described in the article was done, or was visiting at the time, a 'Present address' (or 'Permanent address') may be indicated as a footnote to that author's name. 如果作者现在的地址不是工作完成的地址，例如换工作，或交流访学。应该在名字处添加脚注，指出现在的地址 The address at which the author actually did the work must be retained as the main, affiliation address. Superscript Arabic numerals are used for such footnotes. 这种脚注使用阿拉伯数字的上标。

**Highlights**

==是写给一般的大众读者看的，不在编辑的考量范围内，且到最终阶段才需要。对于搜索引擎的检索很重要，一般的没有订阅的人，是可以看到highlights的。==

Highlights are mandatory强制的 for this journal as they help increase the discoverability of your article via search engines. They consist of a short collection of bullet points 要点 that capture the novel results of your research as well as new methods that were used during the study (if any) ==新结果或新方法==. Please have a look at the examples here: [example Highlights](https://www.elsevier.com/authors/journal-authors/highlights).

Highlights should be submitted in a separate editable file in the online submission system 亮点需要在一个单独的文件中提交. Please use 'Highlights' in the file name and include 3 to 5 bullet points (maximum 85 characters, including spaces, per bullet point). 文件名为Highlights，3-5点，每点最多85个字符，不需要面面俱到，类似于电梯演说，把读者可能在搜索引擎中搜索的关键词包含进去。

**Abstract**

A concise and factual abstract not exceeding 100 words is required 摘要不宜超过100词. The abstract should state briefly the purpose of the research, the principal results and major conclusions. An abstract is often presented separately from the article, so it must be able to stand alone 摘要要能独立于文章存在.

Also, non-standard or uncommon abbreviations should be avoided, but if essential they must be defined at their first mention in the abstract itself. 一般不用缩写，不过可以在摘要做中第一次的定义。

有的期刊要求在100-150词之间。

***Graphical abstract\***
Although a graphical abstract is optional 图片摘要不是必须的, its use is encouraged as it draws more attention to the online article 但是对于在线文章能够更吸引人.

Present simple formulae in line with normal text where possible and use the solidus (/) instead of a horizontal line for small fractional terms, e.g., X/Y ==尽量使用简单的行内公示，例如用/，而不是分式形式==. In principle, variables are to be presented in italics ==变量使用斜体==. Powers of e are often more conveniently denoted by exp 自然对数底数e的指数一般写作exp. Number consecutively any equations that have to be displayed separately from the text (if referred to explicitly in the text). 对所有的行间公式都逐个标出序号

***Footnotes\***
Footnotes should be used sparingly ==尽量少地使用脚注==. Number them consecutively throughout the article. Many word processors can build footnotes into the text, and this feature may be used.

**Data visualization**

Include interactive data visualizations in your publication and let your readers interact and engage more closely with your research. Follow the instructions [here](https://www.elsevier.com/authors/author-resources/data-visualization) to find out about available data visualization options and how to include them with your article.

**Research data**

This journal encourages and enables you to share data that supports your research publication where appropriate, and enables you to interlink the data with your published articles. Research data refers to the results of observations or experimentation that validate research findings. To facilitate reproducibility and data reuse, this journal also encourages you to share your software, code, models, algorithms, protocols, methods and other useful materials related to the project.

Below are a number of ways in which you can associate data with your article or make a statement about the availability of your data when submitting your manuscript. If you are sharing data in one of these ways, you are encouraged to cite the data in your manuscript and reference list. Please refer to the "References" section for more information about data citation. For more information on depositing, sharing and using research data and other relevant research materials, visit the [research data](https://www.elsevier.com/authors/author-resources/research-data) page.

***Data linking\***
If you have made your research data available in a data repository, you can link your article directly to the dataset. Elsevier collaborates with a number of repositories to link articles on ScienceDirect with relevant repositories, giving readers access to underlying data that gives them a better understanding of the research described.

There are different ways to link your datasets to your article. When available, you can directly link your dataset to your article by providing the relevant information in the submission system. For more information, visit the [database linking page](https://www.elsevier.com/authors/author-resources/research-data/data-base-linking).

For [supported data repositories](https://www.elsevier.com/authors/author-resources/research-data/data-base-linking#repositories) a repository banner will automatically appear next to your published article on ScienceDirect.

In addition, you can link to relevant data or entities through identifiers within the text of your manuscript, using the following format: Database: xxxx (e.g., TAIR: AT1G01020; CCDC: 734053; PDB: 1XFN).

***Mendeley Data\***
This journal supports Mendeley Data, enabling you to deposit any research data (including raw and processed data, video, code, software, algorithms, protocols, and methods) associated with your manuscript in a free-to-use, open access repository. During the submission process, after uploading your manuscript, you will have the opportunity to upload your relevant datasets directly to *Mendeley Data*. The datasets will be listed and directly accessible to readers next to your published article online.

For more information, visit the [Mendeley Data for journals page](https://www.elsevier.com/books-and-journals/enrichments/mendeley-data-for-journals).

***Data in Brief\***
You have the option of converting any or all parts of your supplementary or additional raw data into one or multiple data articles, a new kind of article that houses and describes your data. Data articles ensure that your data is actively reviewed, curated, formatted, indexed, given a DOI and publicly available to all upon publication. You are encouraged to submit your article for *Data in Brief* as an additional item directly alongside the revised version of your manuscript. If your research article is accepted, your data article will automatically be transferred over to *Data in Brief* where it will be editorially reviewed and published in the open access data journal, *Data in Brief*. Please note an open access fee of 600 USD is payable for publication in *Data in Brief*. Full details can be found on the [Data in Brief website](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/data-in-brief). Please use [this template](https://www.elsevier.com/__data/assets/word_doc/0004/215779/Datainbrief_template.docx) to write your Data in Brief.

***MethodsX\***
You have the option of converting relevant protocols and methods into one or multiple MethodsX articles, a new kind of article that describes the details of customized research methods. Many researchers spend a significant amount of time on developing methods to fit their specific needs or setting, but often without getting credit for this part of their work. MethodsX, an open access journal, now publishes this information in order to make it searchable, peer reviewed, citable and reproducible. Authors are encouraged to submit their MethodsX article as an additional item directly alongside the revised version of their manuscript. If your research article is accepted, your methods article will automatically be transferred over to MethodsX where it will be editorially reviewed. Please note an open access fee is payable for publication in MethodsX. Full details can be found on the [MethodsX website](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/methodsx). Please use [this template](https://www.elsevier.com/__data/assets/word_doc/0020/203528/MethodsX-Article-Template.docx) to prepare your MethodsX article.

***Data statement\***
To foster transparency, we encourage you to state the availability of your data in your submission. This may be a requirement of your funding body or institution. If your data is unavailable to access or unsuitable to post, you will have the opportunity to indicate why during the submission process, for example by stating that the research data is confidential. The statement will appear with your published article on ScienceDirect. For more information, visit the [Data Statement page](https://www.elsevier.com/authors/author-resources/research-data/data-statement).



**Online proof correction**

To ensure a fast publication process of the article, we kindly ask authors to provide us with their proof corrections within two days. Corresponding authors will receive an e-mail with a link to our online proofing system, allowing annotation and correction of proofs online. The environment is similar to MS Word: in addition to editing text, you can also comment on figures/tables and answer questions from the Copy Editor. Web-based proofing provides a faster and less error-prone process by allowing you to directly type your corrections, eliminating the potential introduction of errors.
If preferred, you can still choose to annotate and upload your edits on the PDF version. All instructions for proofing will be given in the e-mail we send to authors, including alternative methods to the online version and PDF.
We will do everything possible to get your article published quickly and accurately. Please use this proof only for checking the typesetting, editing, completeness and correctness of the text, tables and figures. Significant changes to the article as accepted for publication will only be considered at this stage with permission from the Editor. It is important to ensure that all corrections are sent back to us in one communication. Please check carefully before replying, as inclusion of any subsequent corrections cannot be guaranteed. Proofreading is solely your responsibility.

**Offprints**

The corresponding author will, at no cost, receive a customized [Share Link](https://www.elsevier.com/authors/journal-authors/submit-your-paper/sharing-and-promoting-your-article/share-link) providing 50 days free access to the final published version of the article on [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/). The Share Link can be used for sharing the article via any communication channel, including email and social media. For an extra charge, paper offprints can be ordered via the offprint order form which is sent once the article is accepted for publication. Both corresponding and co-authors may order offprints at any time via Elsevier's [Author Services](https://webshop.elsevier.com/myarticleservices/offprints/). Corresponding authors who have published their article gold open access do not receive a Share Link as their final published version of the article is available open access on ScienceDirect and can be shared through the article DOI link.
